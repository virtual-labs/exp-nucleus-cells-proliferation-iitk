<b> Experiment|     <b>   To Image the nucleus of Cells Proliferation on Biomaterial Surface

### About the Experiment 

Our research group focuses on the fabrication and designing of biomaterials for hard tissue (bone) replacement. The biocompatibility of these biomaterials is tested by performing cell culture studies (adhesion, growth and proliferation) on biomaterial. Examination of the cell morphology is conducted by using fluorescence microscopy technique. Here, in this experiment, imaging of the nucleus of the cells is performed by using a specific dye or a fluorophore which binds to the DNA of the cell and then fluoresces blue under fluorescence microscope
